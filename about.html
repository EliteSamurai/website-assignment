                <h1>About Somalia</h1>
                <p>Somalia, officially the Federal Republic of Somalia, is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti to the northwest, Eritrea to the north, the Gulf of Aden to the east, and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. Somalia has a long history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Paleolithic era. The country has been ruled by various empires and dynasties throughout its history, including the ancient Axumite Empire and the medieval Adal Sultanate. 
                    In the 16th century, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to establish a trading post in the region. In the 19th century, the British and Italians competed for control of the area, 
                    which was eventually divided between them. In 1960, Somalia gained independence from Britain and Italy, and it became a republic in 1969. The country has been plagued by civil war and instability since 1991, when the Siad Barre regime was overthrown. In 2012, a new constitution was adopted, and a new government was established. Somalia is a member of the United Nations and is 
                    working to rebuild its economy and infrastructure.</p>
